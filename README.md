# Secure Blockchain Auctions
The end goal of my VKURA research internship this summer is to create a decentralised application for secure online auctions using blockchain.

As I learn Solidity, I'll start implementing parts of the project with what I know so far. I hope to implement something on par with [this auction](https://github.com/zvdv/Auction-Galal-Youssef), which accompanies the article, "Verifiable Sealed-Bid Auction on the Ethereum Blockchain" by  H. S. Galal and A. M. Youssef.
