# Secure Blockchain Auctions
The end goal of my VKURA research internship this summer is to create a decentralised application for secure online auctions using blockchain.

As I learn Solidity, I'll start implementing parts of the project with what I know so far. I'm working in Remix IDE and I haven't got direct GitHub commitments working so I'm just copy-pasting after each workblock currently.
